SBC Drivers and code for cosmic ray muon timing

## Synopsis

This repo provides code to implement Linux kernel drivers for the BeagleBone Black to do timing studies for cosmic ray muon tomography using GPIO interrupts.

## Code Example

## Motivation

Our experimental particle physics research group at [York
College/CUNY](http://www.york.cuny.edu) is developing a robust,
portable, modular cosmic ray muon tomography system with research
funding from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.  Our goal is
to enable detection of hidden and shielded nuclear materials using -
to the extent possible - robust, off-the-shelf computing devices and
inexpensive plastic scintillator paddles.  The core of each detector
module is a single board computer (SBC), such as the well-known
Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone Black, slaved to a backend data collection
and control PC.
